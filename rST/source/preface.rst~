Not So Cryptic

If you know about QR codes, move along to the next bits.

QR stands for quick response. Like a bar code, it's meant to make information easily accessible for processing - by human or machine.

We take a cue here from innovative educators looking for ways to deliver a personal, multimedia-rich reading experience to our school age-childen.

With a QR code, I can convey a set of instructions, supplemental materials, bits of code - some extraordinary amounts of information in less than 100 square pixels. The code on this page is intended to provide some insight into the design decisions that had to be made to create and deliver the Raspberry Pi. It's a video introduction from Cambridge given by Eben Upton, Raspberry Pi's lead developer. Via YouTube, Upton offers a short description of the device and the intentions that informed its design.

Could we get along without? Surely. We aren't naive enough to believe this will revolutionize print. We fell for that once in the 1990s when "hypertext" seemed uncanny.

To benefit from QR codes, we need a device capable of decoding them. Smart phones with cameras come immediately to mind: apps are available for iOS and Android phones to both decode and generate QR codes. We can also generate QR codes at various sites around the web or from our PCs, if we install the right free software.

Once you download a capable app up to your device, launch it and point your camera at a QR code; when it manages to get a lock on the code, it should process the information and deliver the content in the best way it's been taught.
