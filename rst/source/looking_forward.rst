Looking Forward
***************

To give these features some material perspective, consider the following Raspberry Pi use cases:

* upgrade a TV that accepts either composite video or HDMI into a networked smart TV and streaming media center; 
* automate your home electronics to save on your power bill; 
* create a versatile web server for your home to serve as a personal dropbox, blog, streaming audio server, portfolio, photo gallery, e-book library; 
* build a weather data tracking center; 
* create a surveillance system with motion detection; 
* assemble a gaming center capable of running games intended for everything from arcade cabinets and early consoles like Atari and Sega to 3D first-person shooters like Quake III: Arena. 

At the rapid pace users tend to get moving with the Raspberry Pi, keep in mind that these once-innovative solutions have become almost cliched since the Raspberry Pi was released in March 2012. Where the Raspberry Pi really excels is provoking users to learn, innovate, and produce solutions to everyday problems. And because your hacking is authentic and your motivation intrinsic, you'll hardly notice your increasing mastery:

* the endorsed operating system for the Raspberry Pi is called Raspbian, a remix of Debian, which in turn is a flavor GNU/Linux; 
* if you spend any time at all with Raspbian, expect to pick up linux commands; 
* before long, you'll find yourself producing shell scripts that combine commands you use frequently; 
* routine tasks can then be automated and scheduled to run without you; 
* Raspbian comes complete with Scratch, a visual programming language developed at MIT that introduces high level programming skills through the simple arrangment of blocks - if you're five or older, you'll have your first game complete in minutes; 
* Python, a language popular for its proximity to natural language, is included both as an educational tool and as an essential utility; 

Once the Raspberry Pi is interfacing with the material world - whether byÂ  sensing motion, humidity, temperature or by remotely controlling home media, motors, or vehicles, you will be surprised to find you're not only a programmer and systems administrator, but also an electrical engineer.
