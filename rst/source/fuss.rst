It's the New Black
******************

The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized, $35 computer produced in the UK by a non-profit foundation committed to reforming computer science and engineering for school-age children.

However, because of its extensibility, price-point, and flexibility, Raspberry Pi proved an international favorite of creative hackers and makers since its initial release in March of 2012. In fact, at a December talk in DC, product representative and engineer Rob Bishop announced that the Raspberry Pi foundation anticipated a million sales by March 2013; in the first week of December 2012, a tweet from the Raspberry Foundation indicated that 800,000 units had already been sold.
